## :file_folder: Files Included

The repository includes the following important files:

- `dataset`: directory containing the dataset used for training the machine learning model.
- `face_detector`: directory containing code for the facial detection technique used in the project.
- `detect_drowsiness_video.py`: the main code for detecting drowsiness in drivers using video input.
- `eye_detector.model`: the trained machine learning model for detecting eye states.
- `requirements.txt`: file containing the required Python libraries for the project.
- `training.py`: the code for training the machine learning model.

## 🔏 Prerequisites

All the dependencies and required libraries are included in the file `requirements.txt`. You need to have Python 3 installed on your system.

## ⬇️ Installation

1. Clone the repo

```
$ git clone https://github.com/ahnngo/intellidrive-drowsiness-detector.git
```

2. Change your directory to the cloned repo 

```

```

3. Now, run the following command in your Terminal/Command Prompt to install the libraries required

```
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## 💻 Working

1. Open a terminal. Go into the cloned project directory and type the following command to train the machine learning model:

```
$ python3 training.py --dataset dataset
```

2. To detect drowsiness in drivers using video input, type the following command:
